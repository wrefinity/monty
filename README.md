# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
## The is about monty language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. 

### Monty byte code files
Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. Most of the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the specification of the language. There is not more than one instruction per line. There can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument: [examples](#Examples)

## Objectives:
* To know what LIFO and FIFO mean
* To know what a stack is, and when to use it
* To know what a queue is, and when to use it
* To know the common implementations of stacks and queues
* To know the most common use cases of stacks and queues
* To know the proper way to use global variables

### Resource:
* [Difference between Stack and Queue Data Structures](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-stack-and-queue-data-structures/) || 

## General Requirements
* Allowed editors: **vi**, **vim**, **emacs**
* All files is compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc**, using the options **-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89**
* All files ends with a new line
* There is **README.md** file at the root of the **alx-low_level_programming**
* Maximum of one global variable is allowed
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The C standard library is allowed
* The prototypes of all the functions were included in the header file called monty.h
* All the header files are include guarded
